# otgcImgBackup
Used to backup images from otgc.

Stored images are named so they can be used in the image-server.

This is a old repo so some things might not work as expected anymore.

## config

It's required to set lastBackup to the date you want to start loading.

Loading period is always lastBackup until latest

Date needs to be an ISO Date String

## usage
npm install and npm start

Images will be stored in "rawImages" folder.

Some conversion code is also included but hasn't been run for years
